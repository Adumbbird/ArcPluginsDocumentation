# The one for 5.1

This release is for Unreal 5.0 and Unreal 5.1

* Added 5.1 support
* Added experimental support for 5.1's Replicated Subobject List
* Added `AddReplicatedSubobjects` and `RemoveReplicatedSubobjects` to ArcItemStackBase.  If you add or remove custom subobjects, override these functions to do stuff to them when they are added for replication.
* Fixed include orders to work with the 5.1 include order changes (this applies to 5.0, but has no effect)
