#### The one that stacks items and fixes bugs

* Blueprint Rework: Updated the Swap Item Stack ability to be aware of mergeable item stacks.  It will now attempt to merge item stacks that can be merged, rather than just swapping their positions
* Blueprint Rework: Updated the Item Slot Widgets to show the item's stack size if it has one.  

* Fixed Equipped Ability Info not being set on Active Item Slots
* Added a NetSerializer to the ItemSlotFilter so it is properly replicated to clients
