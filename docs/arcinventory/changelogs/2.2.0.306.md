## The one that adds context to item swapping

* BREAKING CHANGE: Added a context tag to all item operations that involve changing items in slots.  This is an extension of the Loot Tag in LootItem()
   * The Inventory Update delegate has had it's signature changed to include this context tag.  If you bind to that event, you will need to update your code to take the new parameter.
* Fixed an incorrect condition when swapping item slots
* Fixed a crash when trying to add fragments without an owner.


**UPCOMING BREAKING CHANGE**

In Arc Inventory 2.3.0, I will be deleting all of the Arc Inventory 1.0 classes.  Expected Date for that is around June of 2023.  Please migrate to Arc Inventory 2.0's Modular Inventory features before then!  If you are already using the Modular Inventory, you have nothing to worry about or do.
