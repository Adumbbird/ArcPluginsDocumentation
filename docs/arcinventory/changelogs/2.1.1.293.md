## The one that cleaned up various bugs 

This release is for Unreal 5.0 and Unreal 5.1

* Added a CanAttachTo implementation to Modular Item Stacks that accept other Modular Item Stacks, allowing any modular item to be added to any other modular item.  
  * You can still override Modular Item Stack if you wish to change this behavior
* Fixed a crash when trying to replicate null subitems
* Fixed a bug where an item slot with Equipment and Active processors seeing it would conflict with the Ability Info struct (they'd overwrite each other)
* Fixed erroneously removing the active item immediately after adding it during an ItemSlotChange
* Removed the monolithic GameplayTags.h header plugin-wide.  This should reduce the compile warnings in 5.1 
  * There are a few more monolithic headers used.  They'll be fixed in future versions.  Sorry for the compile warning 
* Added const correctness for various Item Stack getters that don't mutably access an item slot
* Fixed a crash when trying to replicate a null item stack in the Item Stack World Object
