# Building The Docs

* Install Python 3.8
* Ensure that Python (and pip) are in your PATH
* run `pip install mkdocs`
* run `pip install mkdocs-material`
* cd into the directory you cloned this repository
* run `mkdocs serve`

The docs should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and will update in real time as you edit!
